For the nebular analysis of both the surrounding planetary nebula and the compact emission knot, we turned to the
photoionization modelling program \texttt{CLOUDY} \cite{ferland_cloudy}. Our goal for using CLOUDY is to create a
model of the two objects such that we can then find the [metallicity/density?]. This(these) properties cannot be directly
inferred from the spectrum of the PN or the CEK due to insufficient data.

The process used in CLOUDY is relatively straightforward. Given a set of parameters defining the nebula, such as the
temperature profile, density, geometry, radius and luminosity of the central star, the program is able to model what
an observed spectrum of such a nebula should look like.

Alternatively, if one knows what the observed spectrum look like, they can vary the parameter space to match the observed
and modelled spectrum to infer the unknown properties.

6.1 Abell 57 Planetary Nebula
In the case of the PN, the temperature profile of the central star has been derived, as explained in Section
\label{sec:5.1} [the section label is missing] to be 90000$\pm$10000 K, the radius is known to be 0.19 pc [I wasn't sure
 where this value came from], and using the diagnostics obtained via the [S II] lines, we are able to infer a density in the range of 0-100 cm^-3.

Using CLOUDY, we varied the metallicity and the radius, while keeping all other parameters fixed. We assumed standard CLOUDY
solar abundances which were obtained from (N. Grevesse, M. Asplund, A. J. Sauval, and P. Scott. The chemical composition of the Sun. Ap&SS, 328: 179â€“183, July 2010. doi: 10.1007/s10509-010-0288-z.)
We then made use of the CLOUDY optimizer to find the radius and metallicity that best fit the known emission line ratios, relative to H Beta.

Our CLOUDY analysis integrates over the entire nebula in 180 individual zones (spherical shells of varying radii), and due to
the [reason for going only till the first hundred shells or so], we used the mean absolute fluxes of the various species
only upto the first 160 shells. We then found the relative fluxes using the mean flux from these shells to then compare to the known values from the spectrum.

\subsubsection{Constraints On Parameter Space}
The known central star temperature puts a constraint on the modelled fluxes of the [O II] doublet ([O II] 3726 and
[O II] 3728) relative to H$\beta$ with a physical range of [I'm not sure what numbers would make physical sense here], and
as mentioned earlier, the [S II] lines offer a measure of the density of the PN (maybe an explanation as to how we do this?).
